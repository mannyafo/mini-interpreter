This project is an implementation of a simple interpreter. The instructions are hardcoded into the class and the
output of the return instructions are printed to the console.

The interpreter is capable of accepting:
- Variables consisting of a single character
- Integers


The interpreter can process 3 types of instruction:
- Assignment    Syntax -> A = 1
- Addition      Syntax -> B = A + 2
- Return        Syntax -> B

Each statement must be separated with a newline because the interpreter parses instructions on this basis.
